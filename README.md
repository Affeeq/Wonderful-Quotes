### This is the second project from the Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide by Maximilan Schwarzmuller on Udemy

#### About
* This is a simple quote generator that creates quote cards up to 10 cards at a time. User need to enter a quote on the textarea and submit it with the button.

#### Code
* This is the initial code that was created by me. It works as it should be. The hardest part about this project is knowing how to ensure the communication between components is smooth and data is updated in all files.
